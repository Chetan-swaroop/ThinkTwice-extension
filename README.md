ðŸ§  Think Twice: A Chrome Extension for Productivity
"Think Twice" is a browser extension designed to help you stay focused by blocking distracting websites. When you try to visit a site on your blocklist, a screen pops up and encourages you to switch to a productive task instead.

The Problem
In the age of endless scrolling and notifications, it's easy to lose focus. A quick check on a social media site can turn into an hour of lost productivity. This extension acts as a pattern interrupt, giving you a moment to pause and "think twice" before you scroll.

 Key Features
 Custom Website Blocking: Choose from a list of common distracting sites or add any custom domain to your personal blocklist.

 Task Management: Create a simple to-do list with priorities (High, Medium, Low) and optional links.

 Productive Redirection: When you visit a blocked site, an overlay appears with a dropdown of your tasks, encouraging you to redirect your focus to something productive.

 Gentle Override: You're still in control. The overlay includes an "I'll be careful" button to proceed to the site if you really need to.

 Simple & Clean UI: An easy-to-use interface that doesn't get in your way.

 How It Works
Add Your Tasks: Click the extension icon to open the popup. Add the productive tasks you want to work on. You can add links (like to a Google Doc or a PDF) and set a priority.

Configure Your Blocklist: Go to the options page to select common distracting websites or add your own.

Browse: When you navigate to a blocked site, the "Think Twice" overlay will appear.

Redirect or Skip: Either select a task to be redirected to its link, or choose to continue to the distracting site.
